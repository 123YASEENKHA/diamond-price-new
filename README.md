Diamond Price Prediction Project
This project implements a Diamond Price Prediction model using Python and scikit-learn. The dataset contains information about diamonds, including carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, dimensions (x, y, z), and price. The goal is to predict the price of diamonds based on these features.

Overview
Data Exploration: Utilized pandas to explore and clean the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Correlation Analysis: Visualized feature correlations using seaborn's heatmap to identify potential predictors.
Model Training: Developed a Linear Regression model to predict diamond prices based on relevant features.
Model Evaluation: Achieved a training score of approximately 87% on the dataset.
Model Serialization: Saved the trained model using pickle for future use.
Files
main.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.
model.pkl: Serialized Linear Regression model saved for deployment.
Usage Instructions
Environment Setup: Ensure Python 3 and required libraries are installed (numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn).
Dataset: The project uses the 'diamonds.csv' dataset.
Run main.ipynb: Execute the Jupyter Notebook to explore data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Deploy Model: Use the serialized model (model.pkl) for deploying the prediction model in a production environment.
Flask App (Server Deployment)
Flask App Files:

app.py: Flask application script.
templates: Folder containing HTML templates for home, prediction, and success pages.
Requirements:

Install required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run Flask App:

Execute python app.py to start the Flask app locally.
Access the App:

Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to access the home page.
Follow links for prediction and view results on the success page.
